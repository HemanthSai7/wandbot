"""This module provides the main entry point for the Zendesk AI Response System.

The Zendesk AI Response System is responsible for creating and updating tickets in the Zendesk system. It uses the
Zenpy client for interacting with the Zendesk API and the APIClient for interacting with the WandBot API.

The system performs the following steps:
1. Creates a new ticket with a predefined question.
2. Enters a loop where it fetches new tickets every 120 seconds.
3. For each new ticket, it extracts the question, generates a response, formats the response, and updates the ticket
 with the response.

This module contains the following classes:
- ZendeskAIResponseSystem: Handles the interaction with the Zendesk system.

This module contains the following functions:
- extract_question(ticket): Extracts the question from a given ticket.
- format_response(response): Formats the response to be sent as a ticket comment.

This module is meant to be run as a script and not imported as a module. When run as a script, it initializes a
ZendeskAIResponseSystem object and runs it in an event loop.
