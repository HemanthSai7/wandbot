Question: How can I log audio with wandb?
================
Content: Weights & Biases supports logging audio data arrays or file that can be played back in W&B. You can log audio with `wandb.Audio()`
Source: 28-pl
Content: # Log an audio array or file
wandb.log({{"my whale song": wandb.Audio(
    array_or_path, caption="montery whale 0034", sample_rate=32)}})

# OR

# Log your audio as part of a W&B Table
my_table = wandb.Table(columns=["audio", "spectrogram", "bird_class", "prediction"])
for (audio_arr, spec, label) in my_data:
       pred = model(audio)

       # Add the data to a W&B Table
       audio = wandb.Audio(audio_arr, sample_rate=32)
       img = wandb.Image(spec)
       my_table.add_data(audio, img, label, pred)

# Log the Table to wandb
 wandb.log({{"validation_samples" : my_table}})'

Final Answer in Markdown: Here is an example of how to log audio with wandb:

```
import wandb

# Create an instance of the wandb.data_types.Audio class
audio = wandb.data_types.Audio(data_or_path="path/to/audio.wav", sample_rate=44100, caption="My audio clip")

# Get information about the audio clip
durations = audio.durations()
sample_rates = audio.sample_rates()

# Log the audio clip
wandb.log({{"audio": audio}})
```
