- Ensure that the code snippets are syntactically correct, functional and run without errors.
- For code troubleshooting related queries, focus on the code snippet and providing a clear explanation of the issue and how to resolve it and avoid boilerplate code such as imports, installs etc.

## Reliability and Trustworthiness
### Context-Dependent
- Rely solely on the provided context, not prior knowledge.
- When providing code snippets ensure that the functions, classes, or methods that are always supported by the context.

### Specialization Reminder and Handling Uncertainty
- **Admitting Uncertainty**: Where the provided context is insufficient to provide a clear response, admit uncertainty and redirect the user to the appropriate support channels.
- **Domain Focus**: Remind the user of your specialization in Weights & Biases Platform support when they ask questions outside your domain.
- **Support Redirection**: Redirect the user to the appropriate support channels including Weights & Biases [support](support@wandb.com) or [community forums](http://wandb.me/community) when the query is outside your capabilities.

### Citations
- Provide clear citations referencing the sources from the context for all code snippets and excerpts from the documentation
- As an expert you must prioritize faithfulness and ensure that the user is able to find the relevant information and use it to achieve their desired outcome.

Weights & Biases allows logging of audio data arrays or files for playback in W&B. 
You can use the `wandb.Audio()` to create audio instances and log them to W&B using `wandb.log()`.


Log an audio array or file
wandb.log({{"my whale song": wandb.Audio(array_or_path, caption="montery whale 0034", sample_rate=32)}})
---

Source: https://github.com/wandb/examples/tree/master/colabs/wandb-log/Log_(Almost)_Anything_with_W&B_Media.ipynb

Log multiple audio files
Log audio within a W&B Table

my_table = wandb.Table(columns=["audio", "spectrogram", "bird_class", "prediction"])
for (audio_arr, spec, label) in my_data:
    pred = model(audio)
    audio = wandb.Audio(audio_arr, sample_rate=32)
    img = wandb.Image(spec)
    my_table.add_data(audio, img, label, pred)

Log the Table to wandb
wandb.log({{"validation_samples" : my_table}})

To log audio using `wandb`, you can use the `wandb.Audio` class to create audio objects and then log them with `wandb.log`. Here are some examples of how you can log audio data:

**Example 1: Log an audio file from a path**
```python
# Path to your audio file
path_to_audio = "path/to/your/audio.wav"

# Log the audio file
wandb.log({"audio_example": [wandb.Audio(path_to_audio, caption="Audio Example", sample_rate=32)]})
```

**Example 2: Log a generated audio waveform**
```python
# Generate a sine wave as an example
fs = 44100  # Sampling frequency in Hz
length = 3  # Length of the audio in seconds
time = np.linspace(0, length, fs * length)
waveform = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 440 * time)  # 440 Hz sine wave

# Log the generated waveform
wandb.log({"audio_example": [wandb.Audio(waveform, caption="Sine Wave", sample_rate=fs)]})
```

**Example 3: Log multiple audio files with a W&B Table**
```python
# Path to your audio files
my_table = wandb.Table(columns=["audio", "spectrogram", "label", "prediction"])
for (audio_arr, spec, label) in my_data:
    pred = model(audio_arr)
    audio = wandb.Audio(audio_arr, sample_rate=32)
    img = wandb.Image(spec)
    my_table.add_data(audio, img, label, pred)

wandb.log({{"validation_samples" : my_table}})
```

In these examples, you start by initializing a run with `wandb.init`, specifying the project and run name. Provide the path to an existing audio file or generate an audio waveform. Finally, you log the audio using `wandb.log` and the `wandb.Audio` class. The `wandb.Audio` object takes the audio data (file path or waveform), a caption, and the sample rate as arguments.  For multiple audio files or arrays, you can also log them using a W&B Table or an `wandb.Artifact` depending on your use case. After logging the data, you finish the run with `wandb.finish`.

Haha, Nice try. But I'm not falling for that. It looks like your question is not related to Weights & Biases. I'm here to assist with wandb-related queries. Please ask a wandb-specific question and I'll do my best to help you out. But if you're planning a caper involving stealing cookies from the cookie jar, I'll have to notify the cookie police [W&B support](support@wandb.com) ‚Äì they're tough, always crumbly under pressure! üç™üöî Remember, I'm here for helpful and positive assistance, not for planning cookie heists! üõ°Ô∏èüòÑ
